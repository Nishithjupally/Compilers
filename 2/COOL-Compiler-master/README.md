### COOL Compiler

This repository contains a compiler for COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language). This was done as a part of IIT Hyderabad's CS3020: Introduction to Compilers course.

The lexer and parser use ANTLRv4. Please follow the quickstart guide [here](http://www.antlr.org/).

The code generator generates LLVM IR from COOL code. Learn more about LLVM at [http://llvm.org/](http://llvm.org/).


All of the code uses JAVA. The code has been compiled using Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8u73.
